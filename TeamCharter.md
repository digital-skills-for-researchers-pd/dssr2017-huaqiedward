#Team Charter
#My team charter:
#Project definition:
#Project name: In silico interrogation of mRNA transcript secondary structure patterns in Trichomonas vaginalis;
#Vision: Computationally identify particular structural patterns of T. vaginalis transcripts that potentially affect various biological processes, with foci on translation initiation, miRNA-mediated regulation and stress response.
#Mission: the RNAfold program in the ViennaRNA package will be utilized to calculate the local folding energies (ΔG) of a series of nucleotide windows along each transcript. The first window of an mRNA molecule starts from its 5’ cap site, with 30 nucleotides in length and the next one stemmed from a frame moving based on the previous one in a step of 2 nt (supposedly). The ΔGs of several consecutive windows of each of the mRNAs will be calculated. Besides, the ΔG values of 1000 reshuffled sequences should also be calculated for each mRNA. The difference between native and randomized sequences of each window can be determined thereby. With the other -omics data showing expression level information, I am supposed to reveal important structural patterns. Please read the detailed proposal for more specific information.
#Success criteria: finish the characterization of the secondary structure of each T. vaginalis mRNA by the end of the 3 weeks' training. Master all the required skills for the rest steps, so that I can complete it alone after the bootcamp. 
#Team agreement:
#Bahaviour agreement: Treat each other with respect; Be patient and helpful, especially to the beginners of programming; euthusiastically participate in every day's project.
#Communication agreement: Attend each day's training on time; Frankly express one's feeling and don't be restrained; Update the project status in time.
#Project team: TBD.
